This package is the software side of an educational platform to help non-verbal children enjoy playing the piano.  It
provides:

1. A Fluid component that wraps VexFlow to allow for visualizing musical notation.
2. A transcriber that records individual notes played and displays them using musical notation.
3. A sample playground environment patterned after the M-Audio Oxygen8 v2 MIDI controller.

This package makes heavy use of these packages in particular:

1. [Fluid infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion).
2. [Flocking](http://flockingjs.org/), a library we use to create synthesizers and interact with MIDI components.
3. [Sisiliano](https://github.com/dinukadesilva/music-ctrls), a Fluid component that provides a keyboard-accessible onscreen piano.
4. [VexFlow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow), a library to visualize musical notation.
